# Publishing a Scala library with SBT in Sonatype OSS for dummies:

When you use a modern dependency management tool like maven or sbt your dependencies get downloaded
automatically. For most of us that's a magic process, most of the time it works and it's great. It
really simplifies dependency management and makes us developers very productive.

That's done through the ["central" repository](http://central.sonatype.org/), hosted by Sonatype
free of charge for [open source projects](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html). 

Let's say you have an open source project and want to release some artifacts for other people to use
through this convenient process. This is a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this, as the
process can be a bit involved.

1. Follow the two steps in [initial
setup](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html#initial-setup)
2. [Create account](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa)
3. [Create a ticket](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?issuetype=21&pid=10134)
    Make sure to fill "Group Id" with your desired name or domain of your project. For example
    "org.example", let's call this $GROUP_ID

4. In [build.sbt](https://github.com/openquant/YahooFinanceScala/blob/master/build.sbt#L3): we set
    "organization" to $GROUP_ID if this is not correct we will get a permission denied error when
    trying to release.

5. build.sbt: Make sure to include a "name" for your lib, for example "mylib"
6. Add the publishing boilerplate as seen in
[build.sbt](https://github.com/openquant/YahooFinanceScala/blob/master/build.sbt#L22) (Lines 22-55)
adjusting the values to your project.
7. Add the "sbt-pgp" plugin globally to sbt:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins
echo 'addSbtPlugin("com.jsuereth" % "sbt-pgp" % "1.0.0")' > ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/gpg.sbt
```


8. start sbt in your project folder
```sh
sbt
```

9. Create a gpg key
```sh
sbt> pgp-cmd gen-key
```

This should create the public and private keys in ~/.sbt/gpg/

10. Import the key in your gpg keyring
```sh
cd ~/.sbt/gpg/
gpg --import secring.asc
```

Copy the key ID in the output:
```
gpg: key 526BA3C6: ...
         ^^^^^^^^
```


11. Import the public key into a public keyserver that central will use to verify your signed jars
```
gpg --send-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu 526BA3C6 pubring.asc
```

12. From the sbt console you can now do
```
sbt> publishSigned
```
This should upload the artifacts, .jar .pom with their respective signatures.


13. Go to [Sonatype OSS](https://oss.sonatype.org/) 
14. Login by cliking on the upper right corner of the screen
When you first upload the artifacts they are in a "staging area" not yet released
15. Scroll down to your artifact and verify that it has the files you want, additionally you can verify the jar with `jar tvf` to check the contents
16. To [release our artifact](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/releasing-the-deployment.html) we need to first "Close" 
17. Check in the activity tab that everything is successful, or address any issues encountered
18. Click "Release"
19. After a bit, we should be able to get the dependency in other projects by adding to the `libraryDependencies`
```scala
"org.example" %% "mylib" % "0.1"
```
20. That should be all, congratulations! your artifact should be available for the world at large to use!
